* In this study, we have developed a computational framework to identify aberrant hypermethylation at single-base resolution based on Hidden Markov Model (**See in framework/**).<br><br>

* Applying this framework to normal brain tissues and IDH mutant gliomas, we found that hypermethylated UMRs present a bimodal status, named partially hypermethylated UMRs (phUMRs) and fully hypermethylated UMRs (fhUMRs). For example: <br><br>

* In contrast to the classical model that promoter methylation represses transcriptional activity for fhUMR related genes, the genes within phUMRs on promoter were prone to be up-regulated and involved in cancer pathways.<br><br>

* We further found that the phUMR contribute to oncogene activation by the interplay with key chromatin modifications.<br><br>

* For example, at the promoter of the CCND1 gene, loss of broad H3K27me3 signal and increase of H3K4me3 signal in flanking UMRs were found. Meanwhile, the gene body of CCND1 presented increased H3K36me3 and H3K4me1 signals.<br><br>

* This implies a novel model of oncogene activated by partially methylation erosion in contrast to the classical model of oncogene upregulation by promoter hypomethylation.<br><br>
